## 🧬 About the Lab

We are a multidisciplinary research group based at the Massachusetts Intitute of Technology, working at the interface of **materials science, electrochemistry, corrosion, and nuclear energy**. Led by **Pr. EricMoore Jossou**, our lab explores the development of advanced materials and technologies for **clean energy**, particularly through:

- Understanding corrosion mechanisms in nuclear reactors
- Developing materials for long-term durability
- Advanced characterization techniques
- Multiscale modeling and simulation

## 🚀 Repository Usage

This GitHub organization hosts code, data, and documentation associated with our research projects. All content is collaboratively maintained and intended for internal and external use under applicable licenses.

### Repositories

Each repository typically contains:
- `README.md` – Overview and usage instructions
- `LICENSE` – Licensing terms
- `data/`, `scripts/`, or `src/` – Research assets and code
- `docs/` – Supplementary documentation (optional)

## ✅ Best Practices for Collaboration

To ensure smooth collaboration, we follow these best practices:

### 1. 🧹 Clean Code and Structure
- Keep repositories organized and modular.
- Write descriptive commit messages (e.g., `fix: correct index error in corrosion model`).
- Remove dead code and outdated files promptly.

### 2. 📁 Branching Strategy
- Use the `main` or `master` branch for stable releases.
- Create feature branches using the format: `feature/short-description`.
- Use `fix/` and `hotfix/` prefixes for bug fixes.

### 3. ✅ Pull Requests
- Open a **pull request (PR)** for all changes to `main`.
- Describe what the PR does and link to any relevant issues.
- Assign reviewers and request feedback.
- Use GitHub Discussions or Issues for clarification and design decisions.

### 4. 📦 Dependencies
- Use environment managers (`conda`, `pip`, etc.) and specify dependencies in a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file.
- Document setup instructions clearly.

### 5. 📝 Documentation
- Comment your code meaningfully.
- Update `README.md` files regularly.
- Use docstrings and markdown files for detailed explanations.

### 6. 🔐 Sensitive Data
- **Do not** upload proprietary or sensitive information (e.g., credentials, internal datasets).
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude such files.
